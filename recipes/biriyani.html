    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Biryani is a beloved and flavorful rice dish that originates from the
      Indian subcontinent, with roots tracing back to Persian and Mughal
      influences. Known for its aromatic blend of spices, tender meats, or
      vegetables, biryani is a celebration of culinary artistry. The dish
      typically consists of basmati rice layered with marinated meat—such as
      chicken, lamb, or fish—or a mix of vegetables, along with a variety of
      spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. Slow-cooked to perfection,
      biryani is often garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, and a touch
      of saffron for its signature golden hue, making it a feast for both the
      eyes and the palate.

      Beyond its rich taste, biryani holds cultural significance and is a staple
      in festivities, weddings, and family gatherings. Each region in India
      offers its unique twist on biryani, such as the spicy Hyderabadi biryani,
      the coconut-infused Malabar biryani, or the fragrant Lucknowi (Awadhi)
      biryani.

      Across the world, it has become a symbol of comfort food and shared
      moments, with variations influenced by local ingredients and tastes.
      Whether served with cooling raita, tangy pickles, or boiled eggs, biryani
      remains a timeless favorite that connects people through its rich flavors
      and history.
