    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Noodles are a versatile and widely loved food, originating from Asia but
      embraced by cuisines worldwide. Made from unleavened dough, they come in
      various forms such as wheat, rice, or egg noodles, each lending a unique
      texture and taste. Noodles can be stir-fried, served in soups, or boiled
      and tossed with sauces, offering endless possibilities for culinary
      creativity. From the savory soy-based flavors of Chinese lo mein to the
      spicy kick of Korean kimchi noodles and the comforting broth of Japanese
      ramen, noodles are a staple that adapts to regional ingredients and
      preferences.

      Beyond their delightful taste, noodles hold cultural significance in many
      traditions. In Chinese culture, long noodles symbolize longevity and are
      often served during celebrations like birthdays and Lunar New Year.
      Italian pasta, a Western counterpart, represents a rich history of
      culinary innovation with iconic dishes like spaghetti and fettuccine.
      Whether enjoyed as a quick snack or a gourmet dish, noodles have
      transcended borders to become a global comfort food, cherished for their
